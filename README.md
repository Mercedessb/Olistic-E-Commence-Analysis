# Olistic-E-Commence-Analysis

## Project
### Selected Topic: Brazilian eCommerce Business Trends

In this project, we analysed the customer orders placed between 2016-2018 from sellers on the Brazilian eCommerce platform. From this datset, we first determined the number of customers by geographic region (looking at zip code prefix, city, and state), most popular products, number of repeat customers and purchases, and total purchases by date. After data cleaning and initial analysis, we used machine learning to make predictions on customer behaviour, which provided seller on Olist the opportunity to increase sales and customer base. 

### Description of out source of data"

The Brazilian-eCommerce dataset from Kaggle, contained approximately 100,000 customer orders, along with corresponding files on product information and English translations of product categories orginally in Portoguese. Nine files from the original Kaggle dataset were chosen for further analysis: olist_customers_dataset, olist_seller_dataset, olist_product_dataset, olist_geolocation_dataset, olist_order_items_dataset, olist_order_payment, olist_orders_dataset, olist_order_reviews_dataset and product_category_name_translation.
